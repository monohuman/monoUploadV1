# monoUpload v1
monoUpload is one of my personal projects: a file sharing service. It is meant to run on a raspberry pi or a device with lots of storage. It stores files for **five hours** until they get deleted form the temporary storage.

# How to use
The setup is very simple. Just make sure you have python installed and run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Go into the folder: `cd [unzipped folder name]`
2. Download packages: `pip i -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program: `python app.py`
